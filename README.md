# Cline Prompts For MCP Creation :]

Ready to build some awesome MCP servers? You're in the right place! 🎉

## 📦 What's Inside?

- `.clinerules` - Your magical rulebook for MCP server creation ✨
- `mcp-llms.txt` - The super-detailed guide for LLM wizards 🧙‍♂️

## 🚀 Before You Start

Make sure you've got:
- [Cline](https://cline.bot)/[Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) - Your AI coding buddy 🤝
- Visual Studio Code - Because we're fancy like that 💅
- Terminal access:
  - Windows: PowerShell
  - Mac/Linux: Bash/Zsh
- Oh yeah also a high context length model. :] ✨

## 🎮 Let's Get Started!

1. Grab this repo (download or clone, you do you!)
2. Give the folder your server's awesome name
3. Clean up the repo stuff by running ONE of these (based on your OS/terminal):

   Windows:
   clean.ps1
   
   Mac/Linux:
   clean.sh

   Mac:
   clean.zsh

   Or manually:
      Mac/Linux:
      ```bash/zsh
      rm -rf .git README.md clean.ps1 clean.sh clean.zsh
      ```

      Windows:
      ```powershell
      Del .git -Force -Recurse && Del README.md -Force
      ```

4. Pop it open in VSCode
5. Prompt Cline/Roo Code to work its magic! :] ✨
